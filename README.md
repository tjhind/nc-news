To connect to databases locally, you will have to create two .env files - one for testing called .env.test, which connects to the test database, and another called .env.development which connects to the development database. In order to set the database for each file you will have to add PGDATABASE={insert database name here} with the appropriate database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for database names).
